                            <a href="/renter">	Rental car sharing </a>is considered a new concept compared to the traditional car rental in Singapore. Despite being a new concept, it is safe, secure and totally convenient for car owners like you when you decide to put up your car for rent. As a car owner, you may have let your friends or family members drive your car in the past without any insurance protection. In car sharing, the safety of your car is our top priority. <!--DirectAsia.com insures all cars during the <a class="nocolorlink"  href="/aboutus">rental car share</a> period to give you the peace of mind that you want. -->Furthermore, RydeKing conducts stringent screening for all our registered drivers before they can start car sharing. Some of the basic requirements we would need are that the drivers must be accident free for the last 3 years, have less than 6 demerit points for the last 2 years and must have a minimum of 2 years’ driving experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It’s easy too! Once you install the iCarbox, you can just list your car online to put up your car for rent. Next, simply confirm car rentals using your smart phone and after the <a class="nocolorlink" href="/car-sharing">car sharing</a> is completed, easily locate your vehicle at its parking location using the Google map link generated by our tracking system. On top of everything, for every car shared you are also reducing green house gas emission by up to 40%. So what are you waiting for? Join the car sharing movement now!

                        <p>

                            Although car sharing is a new concept in Singapore, we’re confident that once people understand how the car sharing model operates, it will change how we look at car rental in Singapore. Besides allowing drivers to save money compared to the conventional budget <a href="/faqs">car rental</a> , drivers can enjoy more convenience and flexibility with car sharing. For example, drivers do not need to collect their desired car from a faraway location because there is always a car near you. Furthermore, with the large fleet available in <a href="/car-sharing">car sharing</a> , you will have access to a wider variety of cars compared to car rental. For example, on RydeKing’s platform, we have vehicles ranging from a BMW 523i to a Suzuki Swift. If you’re concerned with time constraints, don’t be because car sharing is more time-flexible. This means that you can make last minute bookings when you need it unlike car rentals which are often closed when you want to make a last minute booking.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, drivers do not need to meet up with <a href="/owner">car sharing owners</a> for the exchange of keys on RydeKing’s car sharing platform. Our keyless car entry procedure ensures that it’s always a speedy transaction. There also isn’t a need to fill up extensive paperwork like at car rentals each time you rent. Once the booking is confirmed, simply use your smart phone to find the location of the car and unlock the car using your smartphone. Unlike rental cars that are often unkempt and lack proper maintenance, car owners that service their car regularly own all the cars shared in RydeKing.
